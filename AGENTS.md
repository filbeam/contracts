# Bash commands
- `forge fmt`: Format the project
- `forge test`: Test the project
- `forge install`: Install dependencies

# Workflow
- Make sure to run `forge fmt` when you're done making a series of test changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Update [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) and [README.md](README.md) when making changes to the contract API
